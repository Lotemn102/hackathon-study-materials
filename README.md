A basic guide on React Native and GitHub.

*Google Docs files are used because Github's support for Hebrew sucks.*

## Getting started with React Native
Check out this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RxCS-wx9j4AybgooKckxfQGlzkO3CHE6LhwJEwwcu7c/edit?usp=sharing).


## Getting started with GitHub
Check out this [document]().

After you've read it, feel free to use this repoistory for testing.
I've uploaded here some empty react native app. Try to:
- Create new branch.
- Clone it to your IDE.
- Make some changes in the code.
- Commit your changes.
- Push your changes to this repository.
- Make a Pull Request (= PR).
- Accept someone else's PR.

Also!
Take a look on the "Issues" tabs in this repo:

I've added some issues for example. We'll be working in that way for splitting the work between us, and keep track on the project general progress.
You can try to assign yourself to one of the tasks.
